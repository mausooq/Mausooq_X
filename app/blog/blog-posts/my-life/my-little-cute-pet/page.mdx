# My Little Cute Pet 🐢

I have two little turtles. One is bold and cute, and the other is small and shy. I love to play with them.

## Xiba（西巴）
The green one is a red-eared slider, I call him Xiba（西巴）.

I've had it for almost a year now and he's still so small even though he eats a lot!

</div>

It once had an older brother, but due to my negligence, it ran away when I was changing their water.

I hope it is still alive and well. 😖


## Xifei（西非）
The grey one is a West African side-necked turtle. I call him Xifei（西非）. 

I've had it for almost half a year now.

<div className="flex justify-center gap-2 flex-wrap">
  <Image className="rounded-tl-lg rounded-br-lg" width={300} isZoomed src="/blog-post/my-pet/xifei1.jpg" alt="pet image" />
  <Image className="rounded-tl-lg rounded-br-lg" width={300} isZoomed src="/blog-post/my-pet/xifei2.jpg" alt="pet image" />
</div>

It grew so fast that it was even bigger than Siba, and would chase me whenever I put my finger in the water.


Its smile is really healing. I often sit on the balcony and watch them.
